    - File: `thomas_algorithm.py`
    - Description: Python implementation of the Thomas Algorithm for solving tridiagonal systems of equations.

2. **Cholesky Decomposition:**
    - File: `cholesky_decomposition.py`
    - Description: Python implementation of Cholesky Decomposition. Run with the option `1` to generate a positive definite matrix and perform decomposition.

3. **Gauss-Seidel Method:**
    - File: `gauss_seidel.py`
    - Description: Python implementation of the Gauss-Seidel Method. Run with option `1` for convergence checking and `2` without convergence checking.

4. **Linear Regression:**
    - File: `linear_regression.py`
    - Description: Python implementation of Linear Regression. Includes implementations with and without scikit-learn library.
