# Numerical Methods

This repository contains implementations of various numerical methods in Python and C. The methods implemented are as follows:

## Table of Contents

1. Thomas Algorithm
2. Cholesky Decomposition
3. Gauss-Seidel Method
4. Linear Regression
5. Polynomial Regression

## Thomas Algorithm

The Thomas algorithm is a simplified form of Gaussian elimination that can be used to solve tridiagonal systems of equations. A Python implementation is provided.

## Cholesky Decomposition

Cholesky Decomposition is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. Python implementations for generating a positive definite matrix and for decomposition are provided.

## Gauss-Seidel Method

The Gaussâ€“Seidel method is an iterative technique for solving a square system of n linear equations with unknown x. Both Python and C implementations are provided, with and without convergence checking.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Python implementations with and without the use of Scikit-learn are provided.

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial. Python implementations with and without the use of Scikit-learn are provided.
